Races that grant a flyspeed gain the following ability:\n - **Glide:** Whilst using your racial fly speed, you descend 60ft at the end of each round until you're at most 5ft above a surface capable of supporting you.\n\n### Darkvision\n\nIgnore all darkvision information provided by your race. Instead, refer to the below list:\n\n| Race            | Distance   | Race                | Distance |  Race            | Distance | \n|:---------------:|:----------:|:-------------------:|:--------:|:----------------:|:--------:|\n| ***Beastfolk*** | As written | ***Bugbear***       | 60ft     | ***Dragonborn*** | 60ft     |\n| ***Firbolg***   | 60ft       | ***Genasi, Earth*** | 60ft     | ***Golaith***    | 60ft     |\n| ***Goblin***    | 60ft       | ***Kobold***        | 60ft     | ***Orc***        | 60ft     |\n| ***Shifter***   | 60ft       |                     |          |                  |          |\n\n### Triton / Genasi, Water\nGenasi, Water and Triton gain the following ability:\n- **Depthsight:** You can see through water as if you had Darkvision(120ft), \n  which returns to normal vision where the water ends. Additionally, you can \n  see through non-magical dirty/clouded water as if it were clear. This ability \n  does not apply to other fluids such as blood, tree sap or magma (ouch).\n\n### Beastfolk\n\nBeastfolk are being used to represent a multiude of races. For \nexample, Tabaxi are cat-like beastfolk and Lizardfolk are lizard-like \nbeastfolk. Each type of beastfolk, mechanically and roleplay-wise, are \ntreated as seperate races.\n\n### Dragonmarks\n\nWhen in Eberron, dragonmarks. Those born of particular bloodlines occasionally \nmanifest certain recognised dragonmarks, these family lines form houses - which \nare similar to extremely powerful guilds. These guilds keep a strict eye on their\nlineage, so it's unlikely the mark would transfer outside of the family or to \nsomeone the family did not approve of. There are also Aberrant marks, rarely \nidentical to house-related marks and so are tipically unique. There's no \nestablished house for these people.\n\nThe descriptions below are non-mechanical, the full information is in the RftLW book.\nDragonmarks are applied as an alternate race, or a feat in the case of aberrant marks.\n\n<div class=\"col-2 spoiler\"><div>\n\n#### Detection, House of Medani \nRaces: Half-Elves\n\nThe Mark of Detection is an inquisitive's dream. It sharpens powers of observation \nand intuition, allow­ing the bearer to draw connections and interpret clues others \nmight miss. By actively drawing on its powers, the bearer can detect poisons and \nstudy the ener-gies of magic. \n\n</div><div><br/>\n\n#### Finding, House of Tharashk \nRaces: Humans, Half-Orcs\n\nThe Mark of Finding sharpens the senses, guiding the hunter to prey. Alone among the \ndragonmarks, the Mark of Finding is carried by two races: humans and half­orcs. It \nfirst appeared in the Shadow Marches, where clan hunters used it to find their prey. \n\n</div><div><br/>\n\n#### Handling, House of Vadalis\nRaces: Humans\n\nThe Mark of Handling gives its bearer a primal connection to beasts and the natural \nworld, grant­ing the power to calm and coax. This  extends beyond purely natural animals; \nthe mark allows its bearer to guide a hippogriff as easily as a horse.\n\n</div><div><br/>\n\n#### Healing, House of Jorasco\nRaces: Halflings\n\nA halfling with the Mark of Healing can save a life with a touch,  restoring vitality \nand the will to live. When dealing with mundane medicine, the mark helps its bearer \nsense the nature of maladies, aiding them in finding a cure. When equipped with drag­onshard \nfocus items, the mark can even draw the dead back from the  depths of Dolurrh.\n\n</div><div><br/>\n\n#### Hospitality, House of Ghallanda\nRaces: Halflings\n\nThey may not always have gold, but a halfling with the Mark of Hospitality is sure to be \nrich in friends. The magic of the mark allows the bearer to keep a place clean, and to heat, \nchill, and season food. But it also helps the bearer connect with others.\n\n</div><div><br/>\n\n#### Making, House of Cannith\nRaces: Humans\n\nThe Mark of Making guides its bearer through any act of creation. The bearer of the mark can \nmend broken things with a touch, and always has a minor  magic  item they've been working on. \nAn artificer or a wizard will get the most out of the mark, but anyone can find a use for an \nenchanted blade.\n\n</div><div><br/>\n\n#### Passage, House of Orien\nRaces: Humans\n\nThe Mark of Passage governs motion, allowing its bearer to move with uncanny speed. The bearer \nof the mark can even slip through space in the blink of an eye.\n\n</div><div><br/>\n\n#### Scribing, House of Sivis\nRaces: Gnomes\n\nThe Mark of Scribing deals with communication-both the written and spoken word. A gnome who \nbears the mark can fee/ words as though they are living creatures, struggling to make their \nmeaning known. The mark provides a range of gifts. It translates languages, but it also allows \nits bearer to communicate with others at a distance.\n\n</div><div><br/>\n\n#### Sentinel, House of Deneith\nRaces: Humans\n\nThe Mark of Sentinel warns and protects. It heightens senses and reflexes, allowing an heir \nto respond to threats with uncanny speed. It can shield its bearer from harm. Whether on the \nbattlefield or the ballroom, someone who carries the Mark of Sentinel is prepared for danger. \n\n</div><div><br/>\n\n#### Shadow, House of Phiarlan/Thuranni\nRaces: Humans\n\nThe Mark of Shadow lets an elf weave illusions, crafting magic to distract or delight. It \nalso allows its bearer to sculpt shadows, making it easy to avoid detection.\n\n</div><div><br/>\n\n#### Storm, House of Lyrandar\nRaces: Half-Elves\n\nWind and water welcome the half-elves who carry the Mark of Storm, and some learn to call \non the power of the storm itself.\n\n</div><div><br/>\n\n#### Warding, House of Kundarak\nRaces: Dwarves\n\nThe Mark of Warding helps its bearers protect things of value. Using the mark, a dwarf \ncan weave wards with mystic force. It also provides its bearer with an intuitive understanding \nof locks used to protect and seal. \n\n</div><div><br/>\n\n#### Abberant, Unassociated\n\nThe twelve dragonmarks are predictable, and their pow­ers are generally constructive. But there \nis another kind of dragonmark, which is dangerous to both the bearer and the people around them. \nIt usually takes time for a character to learn to control an aberrant mark, and in time, people \nmight be hurt by it. This factor has led to the general superstition that people with aberrant \ndragonmarks are dangerous. Aberrant marks are feared for another reason, too. \n\nLong ago, aberrant marks were more common and some held great powers. Aberrant leader Halas \nTar­kanan could devastate cities with powerful earthquakes. The Lady of the Plague wielded \ndisease and com­manded hordes of vermin. The dragonmarked houses united in an inquisition called \nthe War of the Mark. Some say this was a persecution of innocents, but most feared the aberrants \nand stood by as the houses hunted them down.\n\n</div></div>\n\n## Classes\n\n### Allowed\n\n<div
