You can\n  teleport through wire-mesh or prison bars, but\n  not teleport through glass)\n</div><div >\n\n### Mistletoe\n\nMistletoe costs 1gp, is not found in a spell component pouch and is consumed by spells.\n\n</div><div >\n\n### Slow Natural Healing\n\nDuring a long rest a character does not fully heal, instead they gain a number of HP equal to their character level + Con Mod (Min. 1). You may spend any number of hit-dice to regain additional HP, as you would in a short rest. You can perform this both before and after regaining hit dice (ie. You have 10 total, 7 remaining. First, you spend 2, regain 5 and then spend those 5, leaving you with a total of 5)\n\n</div><div >\n\n### More Difficult Identification\n\nItems are not identified by a short rest and require the\nidentification spell or experimentation or both to\ndiscover their effects. Also note that curses wouldn't\nbe curses if they were trivial to identify.\n\n</div></div>\n\n## Combat\n\n<div class=\"col-2\"><div >\n\n### Combat Fatigue\n\nThe first failed death saving throw you make gives you 'Combat Fatigue'.\nAfter 1 minute or whenever they reach 0hp again, those with 'Combat \nFatigue' exchange it for 1 level of exhaustion . 'Combat Fatigue' cannot \nincrease exhaustion above level 3 and does not stack with itself.\n\n</div><div >\n\n### Flanking\n\nNope. Sorry. Consider the \"Help\" action.\n\n</div><div >\n\n### Thrown Weapons\n\nWhenever you throw a weapon with the thrown property, you may immediately draw a weapon with both the light and thrown properties, provided you have one within easy reach.\n\n</div><div >\n\n### Touch Spells\n\nTouch spells can be case and held using your concentration until they're use or concentration ends. Unintentional touches don't trigger the spell, including someone purposefully touching you.\n\n</div></div>\n`;\n\nPreact.render([\n        <PageHeader title=\"Reign of Strahd - Homebrew Rules\"/>,\n        <div class=\"page-content panel\"><Markdown source={markdownSource}/></div>,\n        <PageFooter/>\n    ],\n    document.body\n);"],"sourceRoot":""}
